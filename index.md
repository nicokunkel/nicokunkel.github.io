## About
After receiving a B.A. in German and Frensh Studies (2014) and an M.A. in German Studies (2017), **I am currently a PhD Student at the University of Konstanz, Germany**. My research focuses on Narratology, Medieval German Literature, and Digital Philology. In my dissertation I work on seriality and mouvance in the late medieval framed narrative "Historia Septem Sapientum" by combining hermeneutic and quantitative methods.
